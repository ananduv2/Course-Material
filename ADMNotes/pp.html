<h1 id="chapter-1.-a-pragmatic-philosophy">Chapter 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy</h1>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Care About Your Craft</strong></p>
<p>Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Think! About Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.</p>
<h2 id="the-cat-ate-my-source-code">1.-The Cat Ate My Source Code</h2>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses</strong></p>
<p>Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation.</p>
<h2 id="software-entropy">2.-Software Entropy</h2>
<p>One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—a sense that the powers that be don't care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short space of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes reality.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Don't Live with Broken Windows</strong></p>
<p>Don't mess up the carpet when fixing the broken window.</p>
<h2 id="stone-soup-and-boiled-frogs">3.-Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs</h2>
<p>It's time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say &quot;of course, it would be better if we added….&quot;</p>
<p><em>People find it easier to join an ongoing success.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Be a Catalyst for Change</strong></p>
<p>Most software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project overruns happen a day at a time.</p>
<p>If you take a frog and drop it into boiling water, it will jump straight back out again. However, if you place the frog in a pan of cold water, then gradually heat it, the frog won't notice the slow increase in temperature and will stay put until cooked.</p>
<p>Don't be like the frog. Keep an eye on the big picture.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Remember the Big Picture</strong></p>
<h2 id="good-enough-soup">4.-Good enough soup</h2>
<p>The scope and quality of the system you produce should be specified as part of that system's requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Make Quality a Requirements Issue</strong></p>
<p>Great software today is often preferable to perfect software tomorrow. <strong>Know When to Stop</strong></p>
<h2 id="your-knowledge-portfolio">5.-Your Knowledge Portfolio</h2>
<p><em>An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.</li>
<li>Diversification is the key to long-term success.</li>
<li>Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk,high-reward investments.</li>
<li>Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.</li>
<li>Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-your-portfolio">Building Your Portfolio</h3>
<ul>
<li>Invest regularly</li>
<li>Diversify</li>
<li>Manage risk</li>
<li>Buy low, sell High</li>
<li>Review and rebalance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio</strong></p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn at least one new language every year.</li>
<li>Read a technical book each quarter.</li>
<li>Read nontechnical books, too.</li>
<li>Take classes.</li>
<li>Participate in local user groups.</li>
<li>Experiment with different environments.</li>
<li>Stay current.</li>
<li>Get wired.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 9: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear</strong></p>
<h2 id="communicate">6.-Communicate</h2>
<ul>
<li>Know what you want to say. Plan what you want to say. Write an outline.</li>
<li>Know your audience. (WISDOM acrostic)</li>
<li>What they <strong>Want</strong>?</li>
<li>What is their <strong>Interest</strong>?</li>
<li>How <strong>Sophisticated</strong> are they?</li>
<li>How much <strong>Detail</strong> they want?</li>
<li>Who do you want to <strong>Own</strong> the information?</li>
<li>How can you <strong>Motivate</strong> them to listen?</li>
<li>Choose your moment: Understanding when your audience needs to hear your information.</li>
<li>Choose a style: Just the facts, large bound reports, a simple memo.</li>
<li>Make it look good: Add good-looking vehicle to your important ideas and engage your audience.</li>
<li>Involve your audience: Get their feedback, and pick their brains.</li>
<li>Be a listener: Encourage people to talk by asking questions.</li>
<li>Get back to people: Keep people informed afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip 10: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It</strong></p>
<h1 id="chapter-2.-a-pragmatic-approach">Chapter 2. A Pragmatic Approach</h1>
<h2 id="the-evils-of-duplication">7.-The Evils of Duplication</h2>
<p>The problem arises when you need to change a representation of things that are across all the code base. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 11: DRY—Don't Repeat Yourself</strong></p>
<p>Types of duplication:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imposed duplication</strong> Developers feel they have no choice—the environment seems to require duplication.</li>
<li><strong>Inadvertent duplication</strong> Developers don't realize that they are duplicating information.</li>
<li><strong>Impatient duplication</strong> Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems easier.</li>
<li><strong>Interdeveloper duplication</strong> Multiple people on a team (or on different teams) duplicate a piece of information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip 12: Make it easy to reuse</strong></p>
<h2 id="orthogonality">8.-Orthogonality</h2>
<p>Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others. Also called <em>cohesion</em>. Write &quot;shy&quot; code.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 13: Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things</strong></p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain Productivity
<ul>
<li>Changes are localized</li>
<li>Promotes reuse</li>
<li>M x N orthogonal components do more than M x N non orthogonal components</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reduce Risk
<ul>
<li>Diseased sections or code are isolated</li>
<li>Are better tested</li>
<li>Not tied to a product or platform</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Project Teams: Functionality is divided</li>
<li>Design: Easier to design a complete project through its components</li>
<li>Toolkits and Libraries: Choose wisely to keep orthogonality</li>
<li>Coding: In order to keep orthogonality when adding code do:
<ul>
<li>Keep your code decoupled</li>
<li>Avoid global data</li>
<li>Avoid similar functions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Testing: Orthogonal systems are easier to test.</li>
<li>Documentation: Also gain quality</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reversibility">9.-Reversibility</h2>
<p>Be prepared for changes.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 14: There are no Final Decisions.</strong></p>
<h2 id="tracer-bullets">10-Tracer Bullets</h2>
<p>In new projects your users requirements may be vague. Use of new algorithms, techniques, languages, or libraries unknowns will come. And environment will change over time before you are done. We're looking for something that gets us from a requirement to some aspect of the final system quickly, visibly, and repeatably.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 15: Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target</strong></p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users get to see something working early</li>
<li>Developers build a structure to work in</li>
<li>You have an integration platform</li>
<li>You have something to demonstrate</li>
<li>You have a better feel for progress</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tracer-bullets-dont-always-hit-their-target">Tracer Bullets Don't Always Hit Their Target</h3>
<p>Tracer bullets show what you're hitting. This may not always be the target. You then adjust your aim until they're on target. That's the point.</p>
<h3 id="tracer-code-versus-prototyping">Tracer Code versus Prototyping</h3>
<p>With a prototype, you're aiming to explore specific aspects of the final system. Tracer code is used to know how the application as a whole hangs together.</p>
<p>Prototyping generates disposable code. Tracer code is lean but complete, and forms part of the skeleton of the final system.</p>
<h2 id="prototypes-and-post-it-notes">11.-Prototypes and Post-it Notes</h2>
<p>We build software prototypes to analyze and expose risk, and to offer chances for correction at a greatly reduced cost.</p>
<p>Prototype anything that:</p>
<ul>
<li>carries risk</li>
<li>hasn't been tried before</li>
<li>is absolutely critical to the final system</li>
<li>is unproven</li>
<li>is experimental</li>
<li>is doubtful</li>
</ul>
<p>Samples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>New functionality in an existing system</li>
<li>Structure or contents of external data</li>
<li>Third-party tools or components</li>
<li>Performance issues</li>
<li>User interface design</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip 16: Prototype to Learn</strong></p>
<p>Avoid details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correctness</li>
<li>Completeness</li>
<li>Robustness</li>
<li>Style</li>
</ul>
<p>Prototyping Architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the responsibilities of the major components well defined and appropriate?</li>
<li>Are the collaborations between major components well defined?</li>
<li>Is coupling minimized?</li>
<li>Can you identify potential sources of duplication?</li>
<li>Are interface definitions and constraints acceptable?</li>
<li>Does every module have an access path to the data it needs during execution?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Never deploy the prototype</strong></p>

<li>Understand What's Being Asked</li>
<li>Build a Model of the System</li>
<li>Break the Model into Components</li>
<li>Give Each Parameter a Value</li>
<li>Calculate the Answers</li>
<li>Keep Track of Your Estimating Prowess</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="estimating-project-schedules">Estimating Project Schedules</h3>
<p>The only way to determine the timetable for a project is by gaining experience on that same project. Practice incremental development, repeating the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guess estimation</li>
<li>Check requirements</li>
<li>Analyze risk</li>
<li>Design, implement, integrate</li>
<li>Validate with the users</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>The refinement and confidence in the schedule gets better and better each iteration</p>
<p><strong>Tip 19: Iterate the Schedule with the Code</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;I'll get back to you.&quot;</strong></p>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>Start keeping a log of your estimates. For each, track how accurate you turned out to be. If your error was greater than 50%, try to find out where your estimate went wrong.</p>

<p>Don't waste a single neuron on the train of thought that begins &quot;but that can't happen&quot; because quite clearly it can, and has. Try to discover the root cause of a problem, not just this particular appearance of it.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-start">Where to Start</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before you start, check the warnings or better remove all of them.</li>

<h2 id="text-manipulation">19.-Text Manipulation</h2>
<p><strong>Tip 28: Learn a Text Manipulation Language</strong></p>
<h2 id="code-generators">20.-Code Generators</h2>
<p><strong>Tip 29: Write Code That Writes Code</strong> Two main types of code generators:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passive code generators</strong> are run once to produce a result. They are basically parameterized templates, generating a given output from a set of inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Active code generators</strong> are used each time their results are required. Take a single representation of some piece of knowledge and convert it into all the forms your application needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-generators-neednt-be-complex">Code Generators Needn't Be Complex</h3>
<p>Keep the input format simple, and the code generator becomes simple.</p>
<h3 id="code-generators-neednt-generate-code">Code Generators Needn't Generate Code</h3>
<p>You can use code generators to write just about any output: HTML, XML, plain text - any text that might be an input somewhere else in your project.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-4.-a-pragmatic-paranoia">Chapter 4. A Pragmatic Paranoia</h1>
<p><strong>Tip 30: You can't write Perfect Software</strong></p>
<p>No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece of perfect software. Pragmatic Programmers don't trust themselves, either.</p>
<h2 id="design-by-contract">21.-Design by Contract</h2>
<p>A correct program is one that does no more and no less than it claims to do. Use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preconditions</li>
<li>Postconditions</li>
<li>Invariants</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip 31: Design with Contracts</strong></p>
<p>Write &quot;lazy&quot; code: be strict in what you will accept before you begin, and promise as little as possible in return.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-dbc">Implementing DBC</h3>
<p>Simply enumerating at design time:</p>
<ul>
<li>what the input domain range is</li>
<li>what the boundary conditions are</li>
<li>what the routine promises to deliver (and what it doesn't)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assertions">Assertions</h3>
<p>You can use assertions to apply DBC in some range. (Assertions are not propagated in subclasses)</p>
<p><strong>DBC enforce Crashing Early</strong> ### Invariants * Loop Invariants: Is true before and during the loop therefore also when the loop finishes * Semantic Invariants: ie the error should be on the side of not processing a transaction rather than processing a duplicate transaction.</p>
<h2 id="dead-programs-tell-no-lies">22.-Dead Programs Tell No Lies</h2>
<p>All errors give you information. Pragmatic Programmers tell themselves that if there is an error, something very, very bad has happened.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 32: Crash Early</strong></p>
<p><code>A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.</code></p>
<p>When your code discovers that something that was supposed to be impossible just happened, your program is no longer viable.</p>
<h2 id="assertive-programming">23.-Assertive Programming</h2>
<p><strong>Tip 33: If It Can't Happen, Use Assertions to Ensure That It Won't</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assertions are also useful checks on an algorithm's operation.</li>
<li>Don't use assertions in place of real error handling.</li>
<li>Leave Assertions Turned On, unless you have critical performance issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-to-use-exceptions">24.-When to Use Exceptions</h2>
<p><strong>Tip 34: Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems</strong> ### What Is Exceptional? The program must run if all the exception handlers are removed If your code tries to open a file for reading and that file does not exist, should an exception be raised</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes: If the file should have been there</li>
<li>No: If you have no idea whether the file should exist or not</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-balance-resources">25.-How to Balance Resources</h2>
<p>When managing resources: memory, transactions, threads, flies, timers—all kinds of things with limited availability, we have to close, finish, delete, deallocate them when we are done.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 35: Finish What You Start</strong></p>
<h3 id="nest-allocations">Nest Allocations</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.-Deallocate resources in the opposite order to that in which you allocate them</li>
<li>2.-When allocating the same set of resources in different places in your code, always allocate them in the same order (prevent deadlocks)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="objects-and-exceptions">Objects and Exceptions</h3>
<p>Use <code>finally</code> to free resources.</p>

<p>Be careful about how many other modules you interact with and how you came to interact with them.</p>
<p>Traversing relationships between objects directly can quickly lead to a combinatorial explosion.</p>

<p>Symptoms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Large projects where the command to link a unit test is longer than the test program itself</li>
<li>&quot;Simple&quot; changes to one module that propagate through unrelated modules in the system</li>
<li>Developers who are afraid to change code because they aren't sure what might be affected</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-law-of-demeter-for-functions">The Law of Demeter for Functions</h3>
<p>The Law of Demeter for functions states that any method of an object should call only methods belonging to:</p>
<pre class="js"><code>
class Demeter {
    private A a;
    void m(B b) {
        a.hello();                          //itself
        b.hello();                          //any parameters that were passed to the method
        new Z().hello();                    // any object it created
        Singleton.INSTANCE.hello();         // any directly held component
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tip 36: Minimize Coupling Between Modules</strong></p>
<h3 id="does-it-really-make-a-difference">Does It Really Make a Difference?</h3>
<p>Using The Law of Demeter will make your code more adaptable and robust, but at a cost: you will be writing a large number of wrapper methods that simply forward the request on to a delegate. imposing both a runtime cost and a space overhead. Balance the pros and cons for your particular application.</p>
<h2 id="metaprogramming">27.-Metaprogramming</h2>
<p>&quot;Out with the details!&quot; Get them out of the code. While we're at it, we can make our code highly configurable and &quot;soft&quot;—that is, easily adaptable to changes.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-configuration">Dynamic Configuration</h3>
<p><strong>Tip 37: Configure, Don't Integrate</strong> ### Metadata-Driven Applications We want to configure and drive the application via metadata as much as possible. <em>Program for the general case, and put the specifics somewhere else —outside the compiled code base</em></p>
<p><strong>Tip 38: Put Abstractions in Code Details in Metadata</strong></p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It forces you to decouple your design, which results in a more flexible and adaptable program.</li>
<li>It forces you to create a more robust, abstract design by deferring details—deferring them all the way out of the program.</li>
<li>You can customize the application without recompiling it.</li>
<li>Metadata can be expressed in a manner that's much closer to the problem domain than a general-purpose programming language might be.</li>
<li>You may even be able to implement several different projects using the same application engine, but with different metadata.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-to-configure">When to Configure</h3>
<p>A flexible approach is to write programs that can reload their configuration while they're running.</p>
<ul>
<li>long-running server process: provide some way to reread and apply metadata while the program is running.</li>
<li>small client GUI application: if restarts quickly no problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="temporal-coupling">28.- Temporal Coupling</h2>
<p>Two aspects of time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrency: things happening at the same time</li>
<li>Ordering: the relative positions of things in time</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to allow for concurrency and to think about decoupling any time or order dependencies. Reduce any time-based dependencies</p>
<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
<p>Use <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Activity_conducting.svg/2000px-Activity_conducting.svg.png">activity diagrams</a> to maximize parallelism by identifying activities that could be performed in parallel, but aren't.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 39: Analyze Workflow to Improve Concurrency</strong></p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>Balance load among multiple consumer processes: <strong>the hungry consumer model.</strong></p>
<p>In a hungry consumer model, you replace the central scheduler with a number of independent consumer tasks and a centralized work queue. Each consumer task grabs a piece from the work queue and goes on about the business of processing it. As each task finishes its work, it goes back to the queue for some more. This way, if any particular task gets bogged down, the others can pick up the slack, and each individual component can proceed at its own pace. Each component is temporally decoupled from the others.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 40: Design Using Services</strong></p>
<h3 id="design-for-concurrency">Design for Concurrency</h3>
<p>Programming with threads imposes some design constraints—and that's a good thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Global or static variables must be protected from concurrent access</li>
<li>Check if you need a global variable in the first place.</li>
<li>Consistent state information, regardless of the order of calls</li>
<li>Objects must always be in a valid state when called, and they can be called at the most awkward times. Use class invariants, discussed in Design by Contract.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cleaner-interfaces">Cleaner Interfaces</h3>
<p>Thinking about concurrency and time-ordered dependencies can lead you to design cleaner interfaces as well.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 41: Always Design for Concurrency</strong></p>
<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
<p>You can be flexible as to how the application is deployed: standalone, client-server, or n-tier.</p>
<p>If we design to allow for concurrency, we can more easily meet scalability or performance requirements when the time comes—and if the time never comes, we still have the benefit of a cleaner design.</p>
<h2 id="its-just-a-view">29.-It's Just a View</h2>
<h3 id="publishsubscribe">Publish/Subscribe</h3>
<p>Objects should be able to register to receive only the events they need, and should never be sent events they don't need.</p>
<p>Use this publish/subscribe mechanism to implement a very important design concept: the separation of a model from views of the model.</p>
<h3 id="model-view-controller">Model-View-Controller</h3>
<p>Separates the model from both the GUI that represents it and the controls that manage the view.</p>
<p>Advantage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support multiple views of the same data model.</li>
<li>Use common viewers on many different data models.</li>
<li>Support multiple controllers to provide nontraditional input mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip 42: Separate Views from Models</strong> ### Beyond GUIs The controller is more of a coordination mechanism, and doesn't have to be related to any sort of input device.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model</strong> The abstract data model representing the target object. The model has no direct knowledge of any views or controllers.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong> A way to interpret the model. It subscribes to changes in the model and logical events from the controller.</li>
<li><strong>Controller</strong> A way to control the view and provide the model with new data. It publishes events to both the model and the view.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blackboards">30.-Blackboards</h2>
<p>A blackboard system lets us decouple our objects from each other completely, providing a forum where knowledge consumers and producers can exchange data anonymously and asynchronously. ### Blackboard Implementations With Blackboard systems, you can store active objects—not just data—on the blackboard, and retrieve them by partial matching of fields (via templates and wildcards) or by subtypes.</p>
<p>Functions that a Blackboard system should have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>read</strong> Search for and retrieve data from the space.</li>
<li><strong>write</strong> Put an item into the space.</li>
<li><strong>take</strong> Similar to read, but removes the item from the space as well.</li>
<li><strong>notify</strong> Set up a notification to occur whenever an object is written that matches the template.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizing Your Blackboard by partitioning it when working on large cases.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think that the activities of a project—analysis, design, coding, and testing—can happen in isolation. They can't. These are different views of the same problem, and artificially separating them can cause a boatload of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 60: Organize Around Functionality, Not Job Functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Split teams by functionally. Database, UI, API</li>
<li>Let the teams organize themselves internally</li>
<li>Each team has responsibilities to others in the project (defined by their agreed-upon commitments)</li>
<li>We're looking for cohesive, largely self-contained teams of people</li>

<p>If a bug slips through the net of existing tests, you need to add a new test to trap it next time.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 66: Find Bugs Once</strong></p>

<p>If there's a discrepancy, the code is what matters—for better or worse.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 67: Treat English as Just Another Programming Language</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip 68: Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On</strong></p>
<h3 id="comments-in-code">Comments in Code</h3>
<p>In general, comments should discuss why something is done, its purpose and its goal.</p>
<p>Remember that you (and others after you) will be reading the code many hundreds of times, but only writing it a few times.</p>
<p>Even worse than meaningless names are misleading names.</p>
<p>One of the most important pieces of information that should appear in the source file is the author's name—not necessarily who edited the file last, but the owner.</p>
<h3 id="executable-documents">Executable Documents</h3>
<p>Create documents that create schemas. The only way to change the schema is to change the document.</p>
<h3 id="technical-writers">Technical Writers</h3>
<p>We want the writers to embrace the same basic principles that a Pragmatic Programmer does—especially honoring the DRY principle, orthogonality, the model-view concept, and the use of automation and scripting.</p>
<h3 id="print-it-or-weave-it">Print It or Weave It</h3>
<p>Paper documentation can become out of date as soon as it's printed.</p>
<p>Publish it online, on the Web.</p>
<p>Remember to put a date stamp or version number on each Web page.</p>
<p>Using a markup system, you have the flexibility to implement as many different output formats as you need.</p>
<h3 id="markup-languages">Markup Languages</h3>
<p>Documentation and code are different views of the same underlying model, but the view is all that should be different.</p>
<h2 id="great-expectations">45.-Great Expectations</h2>
<p>The success of a project is measured by how well it meets the expectations of its users.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 69: Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations</strong></p>
<h3 id="communicating-expectations">Communicating Expectations</h3>
<p>Users initially come to you with some vision of what they want. You cannot just ignore it.</p>
<p>Everyone should understand what's expected and how it will be built.</p>
<h3 id="the-extra-mile">The Extra Mile</h3>
<p>Give users that little bit more than they were expecting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Balloon or ToolTip help</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>A quick reference guide as a supplement to the user's manual</li>
<li>Colorization</li>
<li>Log file analyzers</li>
<li>Automated installation</li>
<li>Tools for checking the integrity of the system</li>
<li>The ability to run multiple versions of the system for training</li>
<li>A splash screen customized for their organization</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pride-and-prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>Pragmatic Programmers don't shirk from responsibility. Instead, we rejoice in accepting challenges and in making our expertise well known.</p>
<p>We want to see pride of ownership. &quot;I wrote this, and I stand behind my work.&quot;</p>

<h1 id="quick-reference">Quick Reference</h1>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Care About Your Craft</strong> Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Think! About Your Work</strong> Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses</strong> Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Don't Live with Broken Windows</strong> Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Be a Catalyst for Change</strong> You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Remember the Big Picture</strong> Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's happening around you.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Make Quality a Requirements Issue</strong> Involve your users in determining the project's real quality requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio</strong> Make learning a habit.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 9: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear</strong> Don't be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 10: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It</strong> There's no point in having great ideas if you don't communicate them effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 11: DRY – Don't Repeat Yourself</strong> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 12: Make It Easy to Reuse</strong> If it's easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 13: Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things</strong> Design components that are self-contained, independent, and have a single, well-defined purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 14: There Are No Final Decisions</strong> No decision is cast in stone. Instead, consider each as being written in the sand at the beach, and plan for change.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 15: Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target</strong> Tracer bullets let you home in on your target by trying things and seeing how close they land.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 12: Prototype to Learn</strong> Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you produce, but in the lessons you learn.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 17: Program Close to the Problem Domain</strong> Design and code in your user's language.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 18: Estimate to Avoid Surprises</strong> Estimate before you start. You'll spot potential problems up front.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 19: Iterate the Schedule with the Code</strong> Use experience you gain as you implement to refine the project time scales.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 20: Keep Knowledge in Plain Text</strong> Plain text won't become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and simplifies debugging and testing.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 21: Use the Power of Command Shells</strong> Use the shell when graphical user interfaces don't cut it.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 22: Use a Single Editor Well</strong> The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable, extensible, and programmable.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 23: Always Use Source Code Control</strong> Source code control is a time machine for your work – you can go back.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 24: Fix the Problem, Not the Blame</strong> It doesn't really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else's – it is still your problem, and it still needs to be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 25: Don't Panic When Debugging</strong> Take a deep breath and THINK! about what could be causing the bug.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 26: &quot;select&quot; Isn't Broken.</strong> It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 27: Don't Assume It – Prove It</strong> Prove your assumptions in the actual environment – with real data and boundary conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 28: Learn a Text Manipulation Language.</strong> You spend a large part of each day working with text. Why not have the computer do some of it for you?</p>
<p><strong>Tip 29: Write Code That Writes Code</strong> Code generators increase your productivity and help avoid duplication.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 30: You Can't Write Perfect Software</strong> Software can't be perfect. Protect your code and users from the inevitable errors.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 31: Design with Contracts</strong> Use contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less than it claims to do.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 32: Crash Early</strong> A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 33: Use Assertions to Prevent the Impossible</strong> Assertions validate your assumptions. Use them to protect your code from an uncertain world.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 34: Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems</strong> Exceptions can suffer from all the readability and maintainability problems of classic spaghetti code. Reserve exceptions for exceptional things.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 35: Finish What You Start</strong> Where possible, the routine or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 36: Minimize Coupling Between Modules</strong> Avoid coupling by writing &quot;shy&quot; code and applying the Law of Demeter.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 37: Configure, Don't Integrate</strong> Implement technology choices for an application as configuration options, not through integration or engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 38: Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata</strong> Program for the general case, and put the specifics outside the compiled code base.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 39: Analyze Workflow to Improve Concurrency</strong> Exploit concurrency in your user's workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 40: Design Using Services</strong> Design in terms of services – independent, concurrent objects behind well-defined, consistent interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 41: Always Design for Concurrency</strong> Allow for concurrency, and you'll design cleaner interfaces with fewer assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 42: Separate Views from Models</strong> Gain flexibility at low cost by designing your application in terms of models and views.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 43: Use Blackboards to Coordinate Workflow</strong> Use blackboards to coordinate disparate facts and agents, while maintaining independence and isolation among participants.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 44: Don't Program by Coincidence</strong> Rely only on reliable things. Beware of accidental complexity, and don't confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 45: Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms</strong> Get a feel for how long things are likely to take before you write code.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 46: Test Your Estimates</strong> Mathematical analysis of algorithms doesn't tell you everything. Try timing your code in its target environment.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 47: Refactor Early, Refactor Often</strong> Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 48: Design to Test</strong> Start thinking about testing before you write a line of code.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 49: Test Your Software, or Your Users Will</strong> Test ruthlessly. Don't make your users find bugs for you.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 50: Don't Use Wizard Code You Don't Understand</strong> Wizards can generate reams of code. Make sure you understand all of it before you incorporate it into your project.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 51: Don't Gather Requirements – Dig for Them</strong> Requirements rarely lie on the surface. They're buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 52: Work With a User to Think Like a User</strong> It's the best way to gain insight into how the system will really be used.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 53: Abstractions Live Longer than Details</strong> Invest in the abstraction, not the implementation. Abstractions can survive the barrage of changes from different implementations and new technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 54: Use a Project Glossary</strong> Create and maintain a single source of all the specific terms and vocabulary for a project.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 55: Don't Think Outside the Box – Find the Box</strong> When faced with an impossible problem, identify the real constraints. Ask yourself: &quot;Does it have to be done this way? Does it have to be done at all?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Tip 56: Start When You're Ready.</strong> You've been building experience all your life. Don't ignore niggling doubts.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 57: Some Things Are Better Done than Described</strong> Don't fall into the specification spiral – at some point you need to start coding.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 58: Don't Be a Slave to Formal Methods.</strong> Don't blindly adopt any technique without putting it into the context of your development practices and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 59: Costly Tools Don't Produce Better Designs</strong> Beware of vendor hype, industry dogma, and the aura of the price tag. Judge tools on their merits.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 60: Organize Teams Around Functionality</strong> Don't separate designers from coders, testers from data modelers. Build teams the way you build code.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 61: Don't Use Manual Procedures</strong> A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 62: Test Early. Test Often. Test Automatically</strong> Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans that sit on a shelf.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 63: Coding Ain't Done 'Til All the Tests Run</strong> 'Nuff said.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 64: Use Saboteurs to Test Your Testing</strong> Introduce bugs on purpose in a separate copy of the source to verify that testing will catch them.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 65: Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage</strong> Identify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code isn't enough.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 66: Find Bugs Once</strong> Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug. Automatic tests should check for it from then on.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 67: English is Just a Programming Language</strong> Write documents as you would write code: honor the DRY principle, use metadata, MVC, automatic generation, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 68: Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On</strong> Documentation created separately from code is less likely to be correct and up to date.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 69: Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations</strong> Come to understand your users' expectations, then deliver just that little bit more.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 70: Sign Your Work</strong> Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too.</p>
